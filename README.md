# highbears_wineReviews
Berkeley DataBears Kaggle team High Bears experimented with this dataset in the Fall 2019 semester.
# File Descriptions
Alina's Wine Reviews: Attempted to run sentiment analysis but was unsuccessful due to the descriptive (versus opinion) nature of the text data. Ran an LDA topic model analysis on the data but most topics were similar since descriptions were all about wine.
# Final Takeaway
It was a good preliminary run but there is definitely more work to be done especially on analyzing the textual data.
